This repository provides supplementary data from the publication "First Record of Prolonged Postmortem Attentive Behavior in Leopard Seals," led by Renato Borras-Chavez and Emily Sperou.

Specifically, the repository contains original photos and videos, including both external and internal views, from the necropsy conducted by Emily Sperou and Renato Borras-Chavez on a leopard seal pup in November 2023 in San Rafael Lagoon National Park, Ays√©n Region, Chile. Based on age estimation features, the pup was determined to be less than a week old at the time of death. The carcass, recovered 28 days after birth, exhibited minimal decomposition, likely due to prolonged exposure to cold temperatures on ice.

Detailed images of the organs are included. For additional information, please contact the authors at Emily_Sperou1@baylor.edu or renato.borraschavez@uri.edu.
